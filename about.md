## WHO AM I

My name is Halit.  I am 24 years old and fresh graduate from university. Currently I am moving to Germany, to start a new chapter in my life.

## WHY AM I HERE

My major on university was chemistry, which is not quite related with any computer sciences actually. But during my undergraduate life, My interest in computer science has grown. I've learned lots of things on my own. And finally I decided to improve myself on machine learning algorithms and data science. And at the end to become an ML engineer. I'll post updates of my journey and lets see how it goes.
